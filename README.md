# notes
Creating a Notes Section to easier review topics I may forget as I go. Essentially to combine with Documentation in an easier format.

It is a Work In Progress in turning all of my various files, and Anki flash cards in an easier location. This isn't to get rid of documentation. That will ALWAYS be the best location for information. This is merely to supplement those.
